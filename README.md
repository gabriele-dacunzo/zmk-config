# Instructions

- Modify [this file](https://github.com/gabriele-dacunzo/zmk-config/blob/master/config/boards/arm/mango/mango.keymap) for different keymaps.
- Once done, commit either to `master` or a different branch; either way, the GitHub Action will trigger.
- Once the action is done, and the compilation succeeds, download the [`firmware.zip`](https://github.com/gabriele-dacunzo/zmk-config/actions/runs/12505880748) file with left and right files.
- Connect each side to the pc, then double tap the reset button to open the internal storage, and copy the file on the NICENANO.
- Once done, tap the reset button at the same on each side to apply the changes.
